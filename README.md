# Children's Story Generator

This is a very simple python script to generate a short children's story

## Description

This is the first script I wrote in Python to tests how the language works. It captures input from the user, then adds these variables to a pre-formatted prompt. Using the OpenAI API it sends this prompt and prints the output. It's as simple as that!

## Example output:

As there is no API key included in this code, you will not be able to test it until you have your own key. This is an example of the inputs and generated output:

>*Who is the main character in the story: ? (Type a person's name or a description: e.g. 'Anne' or 'an elephant')* **Anne**
>*Who is the baddy in the story: ? (Type a person's name or a descriptions: e.g. 'Bob' or 'a witch')* **Bob**
>*What does the main character want/have to do: ? (Describe an action: e.g. 'Get back home' or 'Save a unicorn')* **Save a unicorn**
>*What does the baddy want to do: ? (Describe an action: e.g. 'Stop Anne getting home' or 'steal the unicorn')* **Steal the unicorn**
>

>Once upon a time, in a magical land far away, there lived a young girl named Anne. She was an adventurous spirit who loved to explore the forests and meadows of her home.
>One day, during her travels, Anne stumbled upon something she had never seen before--a beautiful white unicorn! She was completely mesmerized by the creature's beauty and grace.
>Anne desperately wanted to save the unicorn from whatever danger it may be facing, but unfortunately, Bob, a greedy thief, had spotted the unicorn too and wanted to steal it for himself.
>Anne knew she had to act fast if she wanted to save the unicorn. She quickly devised a plan--she would distract Bob while the unicorn escaped into the forest. With her plan in motion, Anne quickly ran over to Bob and began talking his ear off about random topics such as weather forecasts and local gossip.
>Bob was so distracted by Anne's chatter that he didn't even notice when the unicorn quietly trotted away into the forest. After a few minutes of chit-chatting with Anne, Bob realized he had been tricked and angrily stormed off in search of his lost prize.
>Meanwhile, Anne was relieved that she had saved the unicorn from harm's way and joyfully watched as it galloped away into the woods never to be seen again--at least until its next adventure!
